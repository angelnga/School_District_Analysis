Python, Anaconda Pandas &amp; Jupyter Notebook - Perform school district analysis
Overview of the school district analysis

## Project Overview
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. In this project, math and reading scores is replaced for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then, repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:

1. Generate per_school_summary_df for all schools
2. Replace Thomas High School 9th grader test results to "nan" 
3. Run analysis exclude 9th grade for Thomas High School in % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing
4. Update per_school_summary_df
5. Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
6. The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
7. The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
8. School performance based on the budget per student
9. School performance based on the school size
